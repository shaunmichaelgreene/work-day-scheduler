Welcome to the README for Shaun's Work Day Scheduler!

User Story: AS AN employee with a busy schedule I WANT to add important events to a daily planner SO THAT I can manage my time effectively.

This app utilizes HTML, CSS, Javascript, & 3rd-party APis to create a simple work-day schedule planner with the ability to fill each hour blocks with tasks. The user has the ability to add and edit tasks, and can save them for further review during a later session. The schedule automatically highlights each hour block to identify if that portion of the schedule is in the past, present, or future.
